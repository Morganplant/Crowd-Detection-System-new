## Project Proposal: University Crowd Detection System

By <span style="color:#7030a0">Morgan Plant</span>

### **Project Summary**

The aim of this project is to design and develop a University Crowd Detection System for monitoring the presence and density of users in different areas of the university. This system will have the flexibility to utilize either Wi-Fi technology or IoT devices to collect user data. In addition, we will create a user-friendly interface, either a web application or a mobile application, to visualize and interact with real-time data on a map of the campus.

##### Project Objective

- The primary objective of this project is to identify high crowd density locations on campus

##### Example Usage

- The project could be used during a pandemic / epidemic, to view the areas with the most people, this can be useful to a user as they can then avoid certain areas, to decrease the risk of infection.
- The project could be used to indicate whether a room / area is full and, which would save time on the part of the user
- This project could be used to help manage protests and other similar events

#### Aims

1. To create a University Crowd Detection System capable of monitoring and analysing crowed presence and density in university locations.
2. To optimize resource allocation and space utilization across the university.
3. To design and develop a user interface for visualizing real-time user data on a map of the campus.
4. To integrate this new resource with the existing infrastructure of the University

#### Objectives

##### **Primary Objectives**

1. **Design and Development**: Develop a flexible and scalable system for user detection using either Wi-Fi technology or IoT devices.
2. **Real-time Data**: Implement real-time data collection and analysis to provide immediate insights.
3. **Integration**: Ensure seamless integration with existing security and resource management infrastructure on campus.
4. **User Interface**: Design and develop a user-friendly interface (web or mobile application) for visualizing real-time user data on a map of the campus.

##### **Secondary Objectives**

1. **Scalability**: Ensure that the system can be easily expanded to cover various campus locations.
2. **Data Visualization**: Create interactive map-based visualizations for better understanding of user data.
3. **Historical Data**: Store historical data for trend analysis and decision-making.
4. **Resource Optimization**: Provide recommendations for resource allocation based on user data.

#### **Project Relevance**

This Project aims to address proper resource allocation, by allowing users to view the areas on campus, such as the library, university shop, etc. that are busy, or help manage crowd control during events, and provide useful data about said events, this project could also contribute to insights for space utilization, safety and security measures, which would make it a valuable tool for campus management. This relates to the degree I am studying for **Computer Science** because this project is centred on aspects of my studies such as, Human-Computer Interaction for creating the interface for users to check, Computer-Security, due to the nature of privacy featured in this project, Computer-Networks as this project will feature either a web-based interface or usage of Wi-Fi Systems to detect users. as well as Data Analysis aspects.

This project will test the skills I have learned in my studied modules, for instance this will test my Software Engineering capabilities, throughout the entire process, the GUI, web-based or not will test my Human-Computer Interaction skills, as the project is related to crowd density, this will involve data analytical skills, as well as Networking skills. as well as professional writing skills

#### **Resources Required**

1. Hardware:
   1. **Detection Devices**: Depending on the chosen technology (Wi-Fi or IoT), I'll need the necessary hardware, such access to Wi-Fi access points or IoT sensors. These devices will be responsible for collecting user data.
   2. **Dedicated Device**: To process and store data
2. Software:
   1. **Development Tools**: Software development tools, including integrated development environments (IDEs), programming languages, and development frameworks for creating the system.
   2. **Data Analysis Software**: Tools for real-time data analysis, data visualization, and data storage.
   3. **User Interface Development Tools**: Software for designing and developing the user-friendly interface, whether it's a web application or a mobile application.
3. Permissions
   1. Obtain the necessary approvals and permissions for installing monitoring equipment on the university campus. This may involve collaboration with university administrators and compliance with data privacy regulations.

#### **Expected Outcomes**

Upon completion of this project, I anticipate the following outcomes:

1. A functional University Crowd Detection System capable of utilizing either Wi-Fi or IoT technology or both.
2. Real-time user presence data.
3. Enhanced resource management and space utilization.
4. An intuitive and interactive user interface for viewing real-time user data featuring a map.
